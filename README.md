- Automatically calculate the total expenses.  
- Visualize expenses with a dynamic bar chart using Chart.js.  
- Responsive and user-friendly design.  
- Backend in progress to store and manage expenses using MongoDB.  

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è  
### Frontend  
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.  
- **CSS3**: For styling and a clean UI.  
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and DOM manipulation.  
- **Chart.js**: For rendering the expense bar chart.  

### Backend (Under Development)  
- **Node.js**: Server runtime.  
- **Express.js**: For creating API endpoints.  
- **MongoDB**: For database storage.
